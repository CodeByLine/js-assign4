With due respect, @Stephen Catto, The sentiment you expressed seems to be the byproduct of teaching: you know--you've been teaching the stuff for so long, why can't these people just learn something already. Each new crop of students asking the same old questions that have been asked and answered dozens of time--what's wrong with these people. The thing is: beginners (like me) really have a hard time grasping the cryptic feedback. Sometimes combing through the forum helps and often it doesn't--hence the repetitive questions. If we all can go through the forums and solve our code problems, then we'd be on StackOverflow and not Coursera. Of course over at StackOverflow they'd chew your head off and then quarter you for silly questions like "how do I..." So I, for one, really appreciate the help from you all--and I understand with coding one needs to figure things out. 

By the way, just so you know that I know: You and the other TAs (along with Dr. Chuck) offer a fantastic service here--you are teaching digital literacy, much like kindergarten teachers teach literacy (and maybe requiring similar patience). Though some, like me, won't  ever "grow up" to be programmers, knowing a bit about programming will do all of us a lot of good. This is not to say courses like this won't launch some students' careers--I've seen some really good code from other students, but bear with those of us that are digitally challenged (like me).
